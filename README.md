# Routines

Please open the project using .xcworkspace file since I've used CocoaPods in the project.

I've used MVC architecture to develop the project.

What I would have developed given more time:
- I would set the height of the tableViewHeaderView of the RoutineDetailTableViewController dynamically and hide unused properties.
- I would use a UITableView or a UICollectionView to manage the Equipment properties. (I've only parsed the first object to make it simple, since there is only one object in this case)
- I would add NSAttributedString functionality to CircleBorderedLabel to make it look more like in the screenshots.
- I would implement the custom editing (RoutinesTableViewController) like shown in the video instead of using the default one.
